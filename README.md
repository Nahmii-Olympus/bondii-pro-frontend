PolyBond is a bonding serivce operating on the Polygon layer 2 blockhain. It gives protocols deployed an opportunity to own their liquidity by buying them from the retail *Liquidity Providers*, paying them with the protocols native token. A special feature of PolyBond is it gives these protocols the chance to incentive their user to hodl the token and not dump into the market. The Modal for this appropch is a staking mechanism this is economically backed. The reward given to these users is gotten from the protocol whose bond is been purchased.
